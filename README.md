# Overview

This is a copy of Darryl Okahata's original (and brilliant) xcscope mode for
Emacs, with very minor modifications.  I found this somewhere, and had been
using it pretty much unmodified between around 2006 and 2020.

Recently it required some very minor changes to be able to run on Emacs 27.

Enjoy and improve.
